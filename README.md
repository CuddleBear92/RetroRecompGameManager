# RetroRecompGameManager

- Lists Retro Recompilation or PC builds of old games.
- You can add your own titles by adding the github repo, search term for the release file and giving it a title!
- It checks the latest release tag on github per title and caches it for a day.
- It downloads said release on demand and also updates the game files!
- You have a play button and quick links to the github repos!
- It also backs up your game settings and saves if configured! (Recomps are configured by default)

Please add your github token to the settings file so you don't hit the request rate limit on Github!

---------------
This Powershell script is made with Grok and don't expect me to fully know everything about this!
The powershell is just packaged up with PS2EXE for the release tags.
If you want to fix anything or make it better then please go ahead!
